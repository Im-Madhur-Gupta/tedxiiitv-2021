Following his return to his hometown, he became active in many refugee camps to save his people from the terror. Having witnessed the brutality and devastation of the 23-year war that has plagued his country, he chose photography as a means to draw attention to the suffering of Afghans. His works have been published in magazines, newspapers and catalogues throughout the world. His most well known and award-winning piece, The Dancing Boys of Afghanistan, addresses the issue of child trafficking in Afghanistan. At the Nikon-Walkley Awards in 2013, Batoor won Photo of the Year and was a winner in the Photo Essay category."
